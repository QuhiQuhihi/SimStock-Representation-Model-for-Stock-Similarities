## What is SimStock?
In the vast and multifaceted world of stock data, it is difficult to utilize the array of information effectively. Navigating a wealth of information from the stock market, including fundamental, technical, and sentiment data, can often be daunting and labor-intensive. Fortunately, when large-scale data and various data types are considered, self-supervised learning (SSL) holds promise for discovering unique representations (i.e., low-dimensional embeddings) of stock data. In particular, due to their versatility, these representations can be utilized in a wide range of sub-tasks such as forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection. Despite the recent successes of SSL in areas like images\cite{chen2020simple}\cite{jing2020self}\cite{zhai2019s4l} and natural language\cite{lee2019latent}\cite{qiu2020pre}\cite{ruder2018strong}\cite{song2020mpnet}, there has been relatively less focus on SSL for time series data with non-stationary characteristics, such as stock data.
